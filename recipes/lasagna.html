    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasagna.jpeg" alt="Finished lasagna">
    <p>This lasagna is the perfect weeknight recipe
        for a dinner party because we will be
        doing majority of our work the day 
        before. When the time comes, only thing
        you'll have to do will be to assemble it
        on tray and bake it!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <strong>Ingredients</strong>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Spice mix</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <strong>Steps</strong>
        <li>Start by cooking ground beef until
            it has browned to your liking, it should
            take about 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Mix in your choice of spice mix 
            to ground beef and let spices cook
            for 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add your tomato sauce and simmer
            for at least an hour. You can water
            if it starts getting too dry. You have to
            stir occasionally to prevent it from sticking.
        </li>
        <li>In a different pot, add your butter,
            after it has melted add your flour and
            cook it until the rawness of the flour
            goes away. Mix in your milk and simmer for
            15-20 minutes stirring frequently and voila,
            your bechamel sauce is ready.
        </li>
        <li>In a baking pan, layer pasta, bolognese sauce and bechamel
            sauces in order until you used all of them.
        </li>
        <li>Bake it covered for 30 minutes and after your pasta is done,
            top it all of with mozzarella cheese and put it under
            broiler for approximately 5 minutes or the cheese has been
            melted to your liking.
        </li>
